# Interview-Problems

Please complete the following questions. For 1 and 2, please use Java. For 3, you can use any language you prefer. Compilable/runnable code is required, runnable code with tests that I can easily run to verify your submission is always preferred.

Please publish to Github and email me the link or create a .tar.gz file.

1. Imagine we have an interface "GNode" that looks like this:

   public interface GNode {
     public String getName();
    public GNode[] getChildren();
   }

   ** Observe that this GNode can be thought of as defining a graph.
   ** In implementing the functions below, you can assume that any
      graph defined by a GNode is acyclic (no cycles).
   ** Assume that when a GNode has no children, getChildren() returns
      a array of size 0, and *not* null.
   ** You can also assume that all children returned by getChildren()
      are not null.

   Implement a function with the following signature:

       public ArrayList walkGraph(GNode);

   which should return a ArrayList containing every GNode in the
   graph. Each node should appear in the ArrayList exactly once
   (i.e. no duplicates).

 
2. Implement a function with the following signature:

        public ArrayList paths(GNode node);

   which should return a ArrayList of ArrayLists, representing all
   possible paths through the graph starting at 'node'. The ArrayList
   returned can be thought of as a ArrayList of paths, where each path
   is represented as an ArrayList of GNodes.

   Example:
   Assume the following graph:

   A
     B
       E
       F
     C
       G
       H
       I
     D
       J

   paths(A) = ( (A B E) (A B F) (A C G) (A C H) (A C I) (A D J) )

3. Write a quick and dirty program (Shell, Python, Perl, Java, Lisp,
   C++, APL, or whatever) to produce a count of all the different
   "words" in a text file.  Use any definition of word that makes
   logical sense or makes your job easy.  The output might look like
   this:

     17 a
     14 the
      9 of
      9 in
      8 com
      7 you
      7 that
      7 energy
      6 to
      ...

   For this input file, the word "a" occured 17 times, "the" 14 times,
   etc.



NOTE:
The code for the 1-2 problems is implemented in the Graph.java class.
The Code for problem -3 is implemented in the WordCount.java class .The Inputfile path should be changed according to where it is exising on yout desktop.
